    "In contrast to DNA-Seq alignment, RNA-Seq mapping algorithms have two additional challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Because genes contain introns, and because reads sequenced from mature mRNA transcripts do not include these introns, any RNA-Seq alignment algorithm must be able to handle gapped (or spliced) alignment with very large gaps. In mammalian genomes, introns span a very wide range of lengths, typically from 50 to 100,000 bases, which the alignment algorithm must accommodate. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The presence of processed pseudogenes, from which some or all introns have been removed, may cause many exon-spanning reads to map incorrectly. This is particularly acute for the human genome, which contains over 14,000 pseudogenes."

    "\n",
    "1. If a read extends only a few bases into one of two adjacent exons, then it often happens that the read will align equally well, but incorrectly, with the sequence of the intervening intron. To handle this problem, the appropriate algorithm detects potential splice sites for introns (GT-AG, GC-AG, and AT-AC). It uses these candidate splice sites in a subsequent step to correctly align multiexon-spanning reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Concerning the human genome, for which there are relatively comprehensive annotations of protein-coding genes, the annotations can be used to map reads more accurately by aligning the reads preferentially to real genes rather than pseudogenes.\n"
